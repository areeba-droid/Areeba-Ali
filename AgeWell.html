          Interaction Design as the final project. We were

        <p class="section-heading"> User Research </p>

        <p>During the first two weeks of this project, the team conducted extensive research on our user group to find out what they needed.
          Through this research, I found some common needs, goals and activities such as keeping track of health and medication, accessing
          medical history, as well as remembering to take medications on time.
          <br>
          <br>
          With this research in mind, we decided to create a healthcare logging app, which allows users to track specific symptoms as well as
          medications, appointments and reminders.
          <br>
          <br>
          Since we were designing for a specific audience of users aged 75 and up, we also researched how they interact with technology and
          what difficulties they come across while doing so, so that my team and I could create an ideal user experience.
          <br>
          <br>
          Through this research, I found that interfaces need to be kept simple to avoid confusion and that icons and buttons need to be
          labelled and easily differentiable since elders may not recognize them as easily. I also found that the ability to differentiate
          color contrast significantly decreases with age, so our color palette had to be high contrast which I tested by converting mockups
          with different colors into greyscale.
          <br>
          <br>
          Keeping all this in mind, we came up with a user persona and style guide for our brand. Our style guide colours did change slightly
          as we iterated, so the initial wireframes displayed on this page will not be accurate with the below colour palette.

        <p>
          Since we were designing for seniors, we needed to think about our interaction types and how they would affect our user group,
          so we made a lot of changes as we iterated. In the end, we decided to keep the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Horizontal scrolling - it is easier and more natural to scroll horizontally than vertically, and would also be easier on elders
            who may have joint problems in their fingers.</li>
            <br>
            <li >Keeping all interactions simple - gestures like swiping or holding to are generally used by users who are more familiar with technology,
              and through research, we knew that many elders don’t know how they work so we kept all interactions simple.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Keeping all interactions visible - to avoid our users forgetting where to find things or having to use a tutorial more than once, we kept
                interactions visible, especially since many elders have a lower memory capacity compared to younger users. This also aligned with our research. </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="proj-img-container">

              <p class="section-heading"> Wireframing and Further Research </p>

              <p>
                After getting positive feedback on our research and domain, we started with the initial sketching and wireframing of the interface. We kept
                a minimum of 16pt font for readability, had bigger buttons to prevent mis-clicks, and outlined or filled important buttons to differentiate
                them from other content.
              </p>

            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="images/initial-wireframes-AW.png" class="proj-img">
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>
                Some of the key features we included are medication tracking and reminders, event and appointment reminders, as well a daily log for symptoms.
                This allows users to remember which medication to take, when and whether they took it or not and also keep a history of medication, appointments
                and symptoms that they had, which can help healthcare workers get a better sense of their history.
                <br>
                <br>
                A challenge we faced while designing the app was that we couldn’t include all the symptoms for every health concern since that would not be
                relevant to every user and could be overwhelming, so I suggested adding a section in the onboarding of the app that allows the user to pick
                their main health concern(s) so that the app could display related symptoms accordingly. We also added a section in the profile settings which
                allows the user to add or remove symptoms, making the app completely customizable to the needs of each user.
              </p>

              <p class="section-heading"> Interviews and User Testing </p>

              <p>
                After we each contributed to creating a fully working prototype of our app on ProtoPie, we needed to do user testing to see how well our app would
                actually work with users. We were able to find 3 users to undergo the testing, all above the age of 65. Two of them were done in person, while
                mine was done remotely.
                <br>
                <br>
                To run the testing, we gave the users a set of tasks and asked them to voice their thoughts - any likes, dislikes, opinions or concerns - as they completed them.
                This allowed me to get a much more natural reaction to the interface.
                <br>
                <br>
                Right after the testing, we went through a set of questions to ask users what they noticed, to explain their reactions and any additional thoughts
                they wanted to add. I tried to keep the questions open-ended to allow more conversation from the user so I could get even more information.
                <br>
                <br>
                A setback I found with the remote testing was that they asked fewer questions compared to the in-person test, and we had a bit of difficulty setting
                up the prototype and also with the internet connection. It helped in the way that they figured out the app more independently, but I was unable to
                gauge their reactions and body language as clearly, so there were both pros and cons.
                <br>
                <br>
                We all compared notes afterward and found three main issues that our users mentioned:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>It was confusing how all the reminders were shown on two pages</li>
                <li>The main page of the interface was really overwhelming for a first-time user</li>
                <li>The onboarding page is unclear, and there is no way to skip extra information inputs</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                To fix the first issue, we simplified the reminders on the homepage to hide the details, and only show the next two upcoming reminders. This allows
                the homepage to be less cluttered and makes it easier to understand. If the user wants to access more information, they can go to the reminders page.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the second issue, we added a tutorial carousel that the user can view to break down the main functions, icons, and interactions of the app to make
                it easier for first-time users. This feature will be accessible from the settings page and skippable for users who don’t need it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We added a skip button to information that is extra for users to input to solve the last issue. This will help users differentiate mandatory and extra
                information since mandatory information isn’t skippable. Here are the finalized wireframes:

                With seven weeks to research, design, prototype and user test this project, I think my team and I did really well. I learned how to design for a different audience than I am comfortable with, which allowed me to learn how to properly research for the user group. I also learned how to use a prototyping tool and run interviews remotely. For next time, I would definitely prepare more questions and take more notes and audio/video record interviews whenever possible, since it would have been helpful to look back on them. I also learned how to pitch my app to an audience and highlight key points of interest since we had to present to the class each week. Overall, this project has given me a deeper insight into UX and UI design.
