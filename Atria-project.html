        <p>A brand redesign for a non-profit organization that helps poverty in Vancouver, Atria Cooperative.

        <p class="section-heading"> Site and Brand Evaluation </p>

        <p>To begin the process of remaking this brand, we had to determine what was wrong with the previous site and branding.
          We used Nielsen's 10 Heuristics and went through each page of the site to figure out what was and wasn’t working,
          and we took note of everything.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-img-container">
        <img src="images/heuristics-Atria.png" class="proj-img">
      </div>

      <p>
      We found a lot of inconsistencies within their current design, sections that were hard to navigate, and pages with too
      much unnecessary text, which could cause the user to miss the important information. The site did a poor job of
      communicating the main message and goal of the organization.
      </p>

      <section class="element">
      </section>

      <div>
        <p class="section-heading"> Art Direction and Branding </p>

        <p>
          After the heuristic evaluation, we had to start with temporary branding before the designated branding team came up with a
          finalized one. To do so, we brainstormed brand keywords, colors, fonts, design direction, as well as interaction types we wanted to implement.
        </p>

              <img class="proj-img" src="images/styleguide-Atria.png">
            </div>

        <p> In the end, the branding team also liked this proposal, so we kept it as the final version for the project.  </p>

            <div>
              <p class="section-heading"> Wireframing </p>

              <p>
                To start our wireframing process, we looked at other websites and took components we liked from them to implement into our own site.
                For example, we liked the look of bold text on simple backgrounds, asymmetrical grids, and gallery-type image layouts.
                <br>
                <br>
                We would all design different layouts for each page to start, and then pick elements we liked and combine them into the final wireframe.
                With this process, we ended up with both the mobile and webpage mockups.
              </p>

                Although this project was never sent through to development, I still learned a lot from it. I learned how to do design sprints
                with my team to come up with a bunch of ideas, and then narrow down from there. I also learned how to do a heuristic evaluation
                based on Nielsen's 10 principles, which I had never done before. I also now understand how to implement these principles into the
                entire process of my own design.
