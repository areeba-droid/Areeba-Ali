        <p> This project was done for the course IAT 339: Web Design and Development.
          The goal of this project was to create a fully responsive website with multiple
          pages and consistent styling using HTML and CSS. This is a dummy website and
          was made solely for the purpose of this project. </p>

        <p>
          To start this project, my partner and I both chose images of other websites that we wanted to take inspiration from.
          I then picked fonts that would complement the aesthetic of the site, and we picked a color palette to match as well.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-img-container">
          <img src="images/styleguide-LR.png" class="proj-img">
      </div>

      <section class="element">
      </section>

      <div>
        <p class="section-heading"> Development Process </p>

        <p>
          To begin the site, we first created a style guide using HTML and CSS, so that all our elements would be consistent
          throughout the site. We then created basic layouts using flex boxes to display images in rows and columns, and
          linked pages together.
          <br>
          <br>
          After we had the basic site down with all the pages connecting to each other, we added media queries so
          that the site would adjust the number of columns and size of the text based on the user's screen size.
          <br>
          <br>
          Something that I struggled with a bit was making the user flow clear and simple. To fix this, my partner
          and I both did user testing separately and then compared the feedback. I ended up making the buttons
          bigger and adding more ways to get through to different pages (for example adding a static navigation to
          every page instead of just the home page). This made the website flow well on every page and allowed for
          more complicated interactions.

                Through this project, I learned that you should always start coding with responsive properties to make
                the usability better for all audiences. I also learned that when designing, it is important to give the
                user more than one way to navigate the site to make their experience more efficient and easier to get to
                where they need to go.</p>
