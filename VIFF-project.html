        <p>
          For the first half of this project, my team and I did research on different existing sites that we thought we could
          add more to. We decided on the Vancouver International Film Festival (VIFF) website, and we found that their core
          values and goals were to create a diverse and inclusive festival for different film genres.
          <br>
          <br>
          One thing we found lacking in their website and festival was the opportunity for the incoming audience to network
          and connect with the existing directors. To fix this, we decided to make a microsite that helps our user group
          connect and learn from directors at VIFF. To narrow down our users, we decided to focus on film students who
          had recently or will soon be graduating.

        <p>
          For our design direction, we took inspiration from elements seen in cinema to make it feel more
          connected to the audience.

                <p>
                For the second half of the project, we worked on wireframing and prototyping our microsite for both desktop
                and mobile. To implement our art direction into our mockups, we added a lot of cascading elements, text
                overlays, as well as blurred background videos.
                <br>
                <br>
                A problem we faced while creating the wireframes was that the mobile and desktop looked really different.
                We wanted the mobile and desktop sites to both have the same feel and use the same elements while still
                being different, so I brainstormed a couple of ways to do so. In the end, we went with the repetition of
                cascading elements and horizontal scrolling for both. I also simplified the mobile homepage to have less
                text than the desktop site due to screen size and readability constraints.
                <br>
                <br>
                We prototyped our site on Webflow and ended up with an A+ as our overall grade for the project.

              <p>
                This project was the first time that I created a user persona to represent my user group and help guide my
                design, so I think I could have done a better job of creating the persona. I learned a lot about the
                differences between mobile versus desktop, and how to determine what information is essential for a smaller
                screen since not everything always fits.
