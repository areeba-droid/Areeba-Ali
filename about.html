      <p>
        I am currently a third-year student at Simon Fraser University, completing a BA in the School
        of Interactive Arts and Technology, concentrating in Design. Growing up, I always pursued creative
        hobbies, which is why becoming a designer just felt right. I am a UX and visual designer, but I am always
        open to expanding my skills to other areas. I have always heard that design is communication, which is
        why I like to use design to express myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my free time, I like to get involved in my community through volunteering. I am currently part of the
        Interactive Arts and Technology Student Union as the Treasurer, as well as the Finance manager for SIAT
        FROSH 2024. I also am a part of other smaller clubs on the side!
        <br>
        <br>
        Outside of school, I run a (very) small jewelry business, where I can make pretty necklaces to scratch
        my creative itch. I love exploring different worlds through books and movies, and when I have time, I
        will try out a new (or old) baking recipe or pick up my crochet hook to start a new project!
